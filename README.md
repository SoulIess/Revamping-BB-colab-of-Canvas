# Project Description

# Design inspiration
Online class participation has been a hot topic in recent years, due to the
inconvenience and fear of human contact caused by the pandemic. Although almost all
post-secondary have already adapted to the change by utilizing existing systems such as
canvas. As students of Simon Fraser University, we are confident in our experience to say
that there are definitely some major design flaws that exist and after the extensive use
caused by the COVID pandemic, became more prominent. A major flaw of online class
participation is the limited functionality and accessibility of live classes.

# Goal
Our goal is to improve upon the live lecture experience of the classroom UI and
attempt to create an imitation of the classroom vibe; allowing students to feel connected
as if they were actually present in class

questions. The questions are listed in order of publication. Click the plus button in front
